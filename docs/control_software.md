# 3. Drone Control Software
The UAV control plugin takes UAV positions / velocities / accelerations from Gazebo using the C++ API, computes the difference between UAV position and reference from the FlightPlan, computes the control action and computes the forces and moments to apply to the UAV in Gazebo. Moreover, this plugin also send telemetry data throgh topics with the frecuency selected. You could found the code of the plugin in `siam_main` package, in `src` folder. The plugin has been implemented the control present [in this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1729881418820425).
