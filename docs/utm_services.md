# 4. UTM Services <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) is an emerging technology that will be used to manage the increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the airspace. UTM will enable the safe, efficient, and secure integration of UAVs into the existing air traffic management system. The UTM system will facilitate the safe exchange of information between UAVs, pilots, and other airspace users to ensure that UAVs operate safely and securely. To achieve that, UTM will offer something called "_services_", which are information exchange systems, provided by different services providers, such as governments, private companies, etc. 

Some of these services are:
- Airspace authorization.
- Airspace management.
- Flight coordination.
- Real-time traffic information.
- Weather information.
- Conflict detection and resolution.
- etc.

As UTM technology advances, the services it offers will become more reliable, secure, and efficient, enabling the safe integration of UAVs into the airspace. But nowadays, UTM is still in its infancy, and there are not many services available. Services in development must be tested, and this is where U-TRAFMAN Simulator comes in. U-TRAFMAN Simulator is a flexible simulator that allows the development and test UTM services. These services could be implemented in MATLAB, as it is a widely-used language in the aerospace industry and the main language in this project, but **you can use any other language if you want**.

In this 1.0 version, U-TRAFMAN does not offers any UTM service. It just offer a way to implement them. However, in the next versions, some UTM services will be implemented.
