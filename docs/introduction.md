# 1. Introduction <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
The main objective of this simulator is to allow users to develop functionality and realistically simulate flight plans and navigations of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in urban scenarios. Inside this main objective, there are some sub-objectives:
- **Develop and test UAV autonomous control software and services implementations:** control systems of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles could be modified, reimplemented or amplified.
- **Develop and check UTM services:** services and frameworks could be developed and tested to validate if proposals are valid. Information between aircrafts and services can be exchanged through topics, stored and analyzed after simulation to debug. Services could be implemented in whatever platform you want if the platform is compatible with ROS.
- **Provide realistic dynamics simulations of hundreds of UAVs inside an urban area:** due to the physics engine of the Gazebo simulator and its possibilities, UAV behavior could be implemented, making the simulations close to real world behavior.

## How is the simulator composed?
Nowadays, the simulator is composed of 3 main and essential components:
-	**ROS**: ROS Noetic could be the most critical part of the simulator. Provide communication between UAVs and service/software implemented in other platforms. Topics and services are used to abstract communication systems from the development point of view. 
-	**Gazebo**: as is said before, Gazebo offers the entire physics and dynamics engine simulator, as well as the environment and collision simulator. Moreover, Gazebo allows the use of LiDARs and cameras onboard, where behavior of these sensors could be implemented through Gazebo plugins.
-	**Services, analytics tools and gathering data**: a simulator launcher and telemetry viewer are provided in order to offer an example of how UAV are placed in the world, how to send a flight plan and a way to view afterward the route flown by an aircraft. These parts have been constructed using MATLAB.

## Previous knowledge
As you will read in the future section, the simulator is built using ROS and Gazebo. So, it is necessary to have some knowledge about these tools. Nowadays advanced concepts are not used, but knowing how ROS network works, the use of packages, how to create a topic, how to create a service, etc. **is a must**. If you are unfamiliar with ROS, you can read the [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) to learn the basics. If you are not familiar with Gazebo, you can read the [Gazebo tutorials](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials) to learn the basics.
