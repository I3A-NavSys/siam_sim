## What is U-TRAFMAN?
U-TRAFMAN is a simulator for Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) services and software. The main objective of this simulator is allowing users to develop functionality and realistically simulate flight plans and navigations of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in urban scenarios. It is based on ROS and Gazebo, and it is developed by the [I3A Navigation Systems team in High Performance Networks and Architectures group](https://www.i3a.uclm.es/raap/) at the [University of Castilla-La Mancha](https://www.uclm.es/).

## Fetaures
- **Develop and test UAV autonomous control software and services implementations:** control systems of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles could be modified, reimplemented or amplified.
- **Develop and check UTM services:** services and frameworks could be developed and tested to validate if proposals are valid. Information between aircrafts and services can be exchanged through topics, stored and analysed after simulation to debug. Services could be implemented in whatever platform you want if the platform is compatible with ROS.
- **Provide realistic dynamics simulations of hundreds of UAV inside an urban area:** due to the physics engine of Gazebo simulator and its possibilities, UAV behaviour could be implemented, making the simulations close to real world behaviour.

## Install
You could find the installation guide in the [documentation](https://i3a-navsys.github.io/siam_sim/#/tutorials?id=_51-setup).
