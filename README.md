## Welcome to U-TRAFMAN
U-TRAFMAN is a simulator designed for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) applications. Specifically, it is well-suited for the development of software tools and services related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Traffic Management (UTM).


## Features
- **Develop and test UAV autonomous control software and service implementations:** The control systems of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be modified, re-implemented, or extended.
- **Develop and verify UTM services:** Services and frameworks can be developed and tested to validate their feasibility. Information exchange between aircraft and services can occur through topics, and data can be stored and analyzed post-simulation for debugging. These services can be implemented on any platform compatible with ROS.
- **Provide realistic dynamic simulations of hundreds of UAVs within an urban area:** Thanks to the physics engine of the Gazebo simulator and its capabilities, UAV behaviors can be accurately modeled, making the simulations closely resemble real-world scenarios.


## Install
You can refer to the installation guide in the [documentation](https://i3a-navsys.github.io/utrafman_sim/#/install) for detailed instructions on how to install U-TRAFMAN.
